This script shows the barebones structure of the Apple Store.  The store had a lot of navs, and didn't have any asides.  You can see that I was building out the series of divs for each of the banners.  If you look at the commits I have made, you'll see that I added formatting to the 50% off section, as right now it looks odd being the one section that doesn't have strong formatting.  I also would have changed it so that top nav would always be at the top of the page, but I wasn't sure how to represent the difference between the two.
